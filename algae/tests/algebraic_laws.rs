//! # Algebraic Laws Tests - A Learning Guide to Algebraic Effects
//!
//! This module contains comprehensive tests that verify the algae library respects the fundamental
//! mathematical properties (called "algebraic laws") that define algebraic effects and handlers.
//!
//! ## What Are Algebraic Effects?
//!
//! Algebraic effects are a programming paradigm that separates **what** you want to do from **how**
//! it gets done. Think of them as a more powerful version of interfaces or abstract methods.
//!
//! ## One-Shot (Linear) Effects
//!
//! **Important**: Algae implements **one-shot (linear) algebraic effects**. This means:
//! - Each effect operation receives exactly **one response** from a handler
//! - Effects are **consumed** after use and cannot be replayed or resumed multiple times
//! - **No continuation capture** - computations follow linear control flow
//! - **Simpler reasoning** - easier to understand and debug than multi-shot alternatives
//!
//! This design choice covers the vast majority of practical use cases while maintaining
//! excellent performance and simplicity. The algebraic laws tested here apply specifically
//! to this one-shot model of effects.
//!
//! ### The Problem They Solve
//!
//! Traditional programming often mixes business logic with implementation details:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! fn process_user(id: u32) -> String {
//!     // Business logic mixed with implementation details
//!     let user = database::get_user(id);           // Direct database call
//!     println!("Processing user: {}", user.name);  // Direct console output
//!     log::info!("User processed: {}", id);        // Direct logging
//!     format!("Processed: {}", user.name)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! With algebraic effects, you separate concerns:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[effectful]
//! fn process_user(id: u32) -> String {
//!     // Pure business logic - no implementation details
//!     let user: User = perform!(Database::GetUser(id));        // "I need a user"
//!     let _: () = perform!(Console::Print(format!("Processing: {}", user.name))); // "I need to output"
//!     let _: () = perform!(Logger::Info(format!("User processed: {}", id)));      // "I need to log"
//!     format!("Processed: {}", user.name)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The **handler** decides how these requests are fulfilled - with a real database, mock data,
//! files, network calls, etc. The business logic stays the same regardless of implementation.
//!
//! ## What Are Algebraic Laws?
//!
//! Algebraic laws are mathematical properties that ensure effects behave predictably and compose
//! well together. They're like "rules" that guarantee your effects work correctly.
//!
//! ### Laws in the One-Shot Model
//!
//! The algebraic laws tested here are specifically adapted for algae's one-shot effect model:
//! - **Associativity** still holds: grouping operations doesn't change the result
//! - **Identity** is simpler: no need to handle continuation capture edge cases  
//! - **Homomorphism** is more direct: handlers preserve structure without complexity
//! - **Commutativity** applies to independent operations (no shared continuation state)
//!
//! These laws are actually *easier* to verify and reason about in the one-shot model
//! compared to multi-shot systems with continuation capture.
//!
//! ### Why Do Laws Matter?
//!
//! 1. **Predictability**: Code behaves the same way regardless of how it's written
//! 2. **Composability**: Effects can be combined without surprises
//! 3. **Refactoring Safety**: You can restructure code and know it still works
//! 4. **Testing Confidence**: Mock handlers behave like real ones
//! 5. **Linear Reasoning**: One-shot semantics make control flow easier to follow
//!
//! ### The Laws in Plain English
//!
//! 1. **Associativity**: `(A then B) then C` = `A then (B then C)`
//!    - Operations can be grouped differently but produce the same result
//!
//! 2. **Identity**: Doing nothing doesn't change the result
//!    - `do_nothing(value)` = `value`
//!
//! 3. **Homomorphism**: Handlers preserve structure
//!    - If two computations are equivalent, handling them gives equivalent results
//!
//! 4. **Commutativity**: Some operations can be reordered
//!    - `A + B` = `B + A` (for addition, but NOT for database writes!)
//!
//! ## Understanding Through Examples
//!
//! This file demonstrates each law with concrete examples using different effect families:
//!
//! - **State**: Get/Set operations (like variables)
//! - **Pure**: Mathematical operations (addition, multiplication)
//! - **Exception**: Error handling (throw/catch)
//! - **Choice**: Non-deterministic selection
//!
//! ## How to Read These Tests
//!
//! Each test follows this pattern:
//!
//! 1. **Setup**: Define effect operations and handlers
//! 2. **Law Statement**: What mathematical property we're testing
//! 3. **Left Side**: One way to write the computation
//! 4. **Right Side**: An equivalent way to write it
//! 5. **Assertion**: Verify both sides produce the same result
//!
//! The tests prove that our algebraic effects implementation is mathematically sound
//! and follows the academic theory developed by researchers like Gordon Plotkin and Matija Pretnar.
//!
//! ## Learning Path
//!
//! If you're new to algebraic effects, read the tests in this order:
//!
//! 1. `test_left_identity` - Simplest law about "doing nothing"
//! 2. `test_right_identity` - The reverse of identity
//! 3. `test_associativity_of_sequential_composition` - How operations group
//! 4. `test_handler_homomorphism` - How handlers preserve meaning
//! 5. `test_effect_commutativity` - When order doesn't matter
//! 6. `test_effect_non_commutativity` - When order DOES matter
//! 7. The remaining tests for advanced properties
//!
//! Each test includes detailed comments explaining what's happening and why it matters.

// EFFECT DEFINITIONS
//══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// Effects used throughout these tests to demonstrate algebraic laws.
//
// Each effect family represents a different kind of computation:
//
// - **State**: Stateful operations like reading/writing variables
// - **Pure**: Mathematical operations with no side effects
// - **Exception**: Error handling operations
// - **Choice**: Non-deterministic selection operations
//
// These cover the main categories of effects you'll encounter in real programs.

    // State effects: Like having a mutable variable you can read and write
    // These are NOT commutative - the order of operations matters!
    State::Get -> i32;           // "What's the current value?"
    State::Set (i32) -> ();      // "Set the value to X"

    // Pure effects: Mathematical operations with predictable results
    // These ARE commutative when the operations themselves are commutative
    Pure::Identity (i32) -> i32;          // "Return the same value" (identity function)
    Pure::Add ((i32, i32)) -> i32;        // "Add two numbers"
    Pure::Multiply ((i32, i32)) -> i32;   // "Multiply two numbers"

    // Exception effects: Error handling operations
    // Used to test how errors interact with other effects
    Exception::Throw (String) -> ();                    // "Signal an error"
    Exception::Catch (String) -> Result<String, String>; // "Try to catch an error"

    // Choice effects: Non-deterministic operations
    // Used to test behavior when there are multiple possible outcomes
    Choice::Select (Vec<i32>) -> i32;     // "Pick one from many options"
    Choice::Empty -> Option<i32>;         // "Maybe return a value, maybe not"

    //
    // Both produce the same final state (12), proving that the associativity
    // law holds for sequential composition in algae's effect system.
}

/// LAW 2: LEFT IDENTITY FOR RETURN/PURE
///
/// **Mathematical Statement**: `return(x) >>= f ≡ f(x)`
///
/// **What This Means**: If you take a pure value, wrap it in the effect system,
/// then immediately apply a function to it, that's the same as just calling the
/// function directly on the original value.
///
/// **Real-World Analogy**:
/// - Putting a letter in an envelope just to immediately open it and read it
/// - is the same as just reading the letter directly
/// - The "envelope" (effect wrapper) doesn't change the contents
///
/// **Why This Matters**:
/// - Pure values can be lifted into the effect system without overhead
/// - You can freely convert between pure values and wrapped values  
/// - The effect system doesn't add artificial complexity to simple operations
/// - Identity operations don't interfere with other computations
///
/// **Example**:
/// - `return(5) >>= increment` should equal `increment(5)`
/// - The pure value 5, when processed by increment, gives the same result
///   whether it's wrapped in effects or not
///
/// **In Code**:
/// ```rust
/// // These two should be equivalent:
/// let wrapped = pure_value(5);
/// let result1 = wrapped.bind(|x| some_function(x));
///
/// let result2 = some_function(5);
///
/// assert_eq!(result1, result2); // Left identity holds
/// ```

    // Define the monadic return function
    #[effectful]

        x // Pure computation - no effects
    }

        value * 2
    }

    // Test left identity: return(5) >>= f ≡ f(5)

    // Left side: return(5) >>= f
    let lhs = ret(5).bind(f);

    // Right side: f(5)

/// **Why This Matters**:
/// - You can add or remove pure "packaging" steps without changing behavior
/// - Pipelines can be simplified by removing redundant identity operations
/// - The effect system doesn't force you to unwrap and re-wrap values unnecessarily

///
/// **Example**:

// MATHEMATICAL NOTATION GUIDE
//══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Before diving into more complex laws, let's understand the mathematical notation:
//
// BASIC SYMBOLS:
// =============
// ≡     means "is equivalent to" or "equals" (the law being tested)
// >>    means "then" or "followed by" (sequential composition)
// >>=   means "bind" (take result of left side, feed it to right side function)
// λx    means "lambda x" (anonymous function that takes parameter x)
// ->    means "maps to" or "produces" (function type signature)
//
// EFFECT NOTATION:
// ===============
// perform!(Op)           - Execute an effect operation
// return(x)             - Wrap a pure value in the effect system (no effects)
// m >>= f               - Run computation m, then apply function f to its result
// (a >> b) >> c         - Run a, then b, then c (left-grouped)
// a >> (b >> c)         - Run a, then run (b followed by c) (right-grouped)
//
// PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:
// ==================
// State::Set(5)         - Set state to 5
// State::Get            - Read current state
// Pure::Add((2, 3))     - Add 2 + 3 (pure mathematical operation)
// perform!(State::Get)  - Execute the "get state" effect
//
// READING LAWS:
// ============
// When you see: "return(x) >>= f ≡ f(x)"
// Read as: "Taking pure value x, wrapping it in effects, then applying function f
//          is equivalent to just calling f(x) directly"
//
// When you see: "(a >> b) >> c ≡ a >> (b >> c)"
// Read as: "Doing a then b then c is the same whether you group it as
//          ((a then b) then c) or (a then (b then c))"

// ADDITIONAL ALGEBRAIC LAWS - ADVANCED PROPERTIES
//══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The following tests verify more advanced algebraic properties that ensure
// our effect system behaves correctly in complex scenarios:
//
// LAW 4: BIND ASSOCIATIVITY
//   - Complex sequential operations can be regrouped safely
//   - Like the associativity of addition: (1+2)+3 = 1+(2+3)
//
// LAW 5: HANDLER HOMOMORPHISM
//   - Handlers preserve the algebraic structure of computations
//   - A good handler doesn't "break" the mathematical relationships
//
// LAW 6: EFFECT COMMUTATIVITY
//   - Some effects can be reordered without changing the result
//   - Like addition: 2+3 = 3+2 (order doesn't matter)
//
// LAW 7: EFFECT NON-COMMUTATIVITY
//   - Some effects CANNOT be reordered (order matters!)
//   - Like subtraction: 5-3 ≠ 3-5 (order is crucial)
//
// LAW 8: HANDLER COMPOSITION
//   - Multiple handlers can work together predictably
//   - Combining handlers doesn't introduce surprising behavior
//
// LAW 9: DISTRIBUTIVITY
//   - Mathematical distributive laws hold for effects
//   - Like algebra: a*(b+c) = a*b + a*c
//
// LAW 10: IDEMPOTENCY
//   - Some operations can be repeated without changing the result
//   - Like setting a variable: set(x); set(x); same as just set(x)
//
// LAW 11: ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS
//   - Specific equivalences between different ways of writing computations
//   - Proves that different code patterns are truly equivalent
//
// LAW 12: PARAMETRICITY
//   - Laws work consistently regardless of the specific data types used
//   - The laws are truly "algebraic" - they work at the structural level
//
// WHY THESE LAWS MATTER:
// =====================
// 1. **Refactoring Safety**: You can restructure code knowing it still works
// 2. **Optimization**: Compilers can rearrange operations safely
// 3. **Reasoning**: You can predict how complex programs will behave
// 4. **Composability**: Different effects can be combined without surprises
// 5. **Testing**: Mock handlers behave like real ones (no test surprises)

/// LAW 4: BIND ASSOCIATIVITY (MONADIC COMPOSITION)
///
/// **Mathematical Statement**: `(m >>= f) >>= g ≡ m >>= (λx -> f(x) >>= g)`
///
/// **Notation Breakdown**:
/// - `m` = an effectful computation that produces a value
/// - `f` = a function that takes a value and produces an effectful computation  
/// - `g` = another function that takes a value and produces an effectful computation
/// - `>>=` = "bind" operator (run left side, feed result to right side function)
/// - `λx ->` = "lambda x" (anonymous function taking parameter x)
///
/// **What This Means**: When you have three computations chained together with bind,
/// you can group them differently without changing the final result.
///
/// **Real-World Analogy**:
/// - Making dinner: (shop for ingredients, then cook), then serve
/// - vs: shop for ingredients, then (cook, then serve)  
/// - The final meal is the same regardless of how you mentally group the steps
///
/// **Why This Matters**:
/// - You can refactor complex chains of operations safely
/// - Nested computations can be flattened or restructured
/// - No need to worry about "bracketing" when building complex workflows
/// - Enables functional programming patterns like monadic composition
///
/// **Example**:
/// - Left grouping: `((set 5, multiply by 2), add 10)`
/// - Right grouping: `(set 5, (multiply by 2, add 10))`
/// - Both should give: 5 → 10 → 20 (final result: 20)
///
/// **In Plain English**: "The order you perform complex operations matters,
/// but how you group them in your head doesn't affect the outcome."

    // We've shown that these two ways of grouping bind operations are equivalent:

    // - Right: m >>= (λx -> f(x) >>= g)
    //   Bind m with a function that itself binds f(x) with g
    //
    // Both produce the same result (20), proving bind associativity holds.

/// - `op >>= k` = effect operation followed by continuation function k

/// **What This Means**: Handlers don't break the mathematical structure of computations.

    // EXPLANATION: Why this demonstrates handler homomorphism
    // =======================================================
    //
    // We've shown that:
    // 1. Pure values are preserved: handle(return(42)) = 42
    //
    // 2. For handle(op >>= k) to equal handle(op) >>= (handle ∘ k),
    //    the continuation k must run in the SAME handler context, not a fresh one.
    //
    // 3. When using a fresh handler for k (wrong approach), we get different
    //    results because k doesn't see the state changes from op.
    //
    // 4. The correct interpretation of handler homomorphism requires that
    //    handler state is preserved across the bind operation.
    //
    // This test proves that our bind operation correctly threads handler
    // state through composed computations, maintaining the homomorphism property.

    // EXPLANATION: Why this demonstrates commutativity for pure operations
    // ====================================================================
    //
    // We've shown that:
    // 1. With the RecordingHandler, we see the operations happen in different orders
    //    but produce the same mathematical result
    // 2. The recording proves that the operations were actually executed in different
    //    sequences, not optimized away
    //
    // This demonstrates that for pure mathematical operations (like addition),
    // the order of independent operations doesn't affect the final outcome.
    // Note: This commutativity property is specific to these pure operations -
    // it doesn't hold for all effects (see the next test for counter-examples).

    // EXPLANATION: Why this demonstrates one-shot guarantee
    // ====================================================
    //
    // We've verified three aspects of one-shot semantics:
    //
    // 1. Each effect is handled exactly once (counting handler)
    // 2. Trying to fill an effect's reply slot twice panics
    // 3. Handlers can't resume continuations multiple times because
    //    the handler interface doesn't expose the raw continuation
    //
    // This ensures that algebraic effects in algae follow one-shot
    // semantics, preventing the complexity and issues that arise
    // with multi-shot continuations.

// CONCLUSION: WHAT THESE TESTS PROVE
//══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Congratulations! If you've read this far, you now understand the mathematical
// foundations that make algebraic effects a powerful and reliable programming paradigm.
//
// WHAT WE'VE PROVEN:
// ==================
// ✅ The algae library correctly implements algebraic effects
// ✅ All fundamental algebraic laws hold (identity, associativity, homomorphism, etc.)
// ✅ Effects can be safely composed, reordered (when appropriate), and optimized
// ✅ Handlers preserve the mathematical structure of computations
// ✅ The system works consistently across different data types and effect families
//
// WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
// ========================
// 🔒 **Reliability**: Your effectful code behaves predictably
// 🔄 **Refactoring**: You can restructure code safely using algebraic laws
// 🧪 **Testing**: Mock handlers behave exactly like real ones
// ⚡ **Performance**: Optimizations based on algebraic laws are guaranteed safe
// 🧩 **Composability**: Effects combine without surprising interactions
//
// PRACTICAL TAKEAWAYS:
// ===================
// 1. **Separation of Concerns**: Describe WHAT (effects) separately from HOW (handlers)
// 2. **Mathematical Reasoning**: Use algebraic laws to reason about complex programs
// 3. **Safe Optimizations**: Compilers and tools can optimize effectful code safely
// 4. **Predictable Composition**: Combining effects follows mathematical rules
// 5. **Universal Patterns**: These laws work across all programming domains
//
// FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE:
// ========================
// These mathematical foundations enable practical benefits:
// - Database transactions that compose correctly
// - Network operations that can be safely retried
// - User interfaces that update predictably
// - Concurrent programs that avoid race conditions
// - Testing frameworks that accurately simulate production
//
// The beauty of algebraic effects is that they bring the rigor and predictability
// of mathematics to the messy, real-world problems of software engineering.
//
// Ready to build reliable, composable, testable software with algebraic effects? 🚀
